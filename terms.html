    <h3>3. Safety; Your Interactions with Other Members</h3>
    <br>

    <p>Though Campus Friends strives to encourage a respectful member experience that allows members to
      communicate only after they have both indicated interest in one another, Campus Friends is not
      responsible for the conduct of any member on or off of the Services. You agree to use caution in all
      interactions with other members, particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in
      person. You agree that you will not provide your financial information (for example, your credit card
      or bank profile information), or wire or otherwise send money to other members.</p>
    <br>
    <p>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS. YOU
      UNDERSTAND THAT CAMPUS FRIENDS DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND
      CHECKS ON ITS MEMBERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS
      MEMBERS. CAMPUS FRIENDS MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE
      CONDUCT OR COMPATIBILITY OF MEMBERS. SEX OFFENDER SCREENINGS AND OTHER
      TOOLS DO NOT GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY AND ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR
      FOLLOWING THE SAFETY TIPS AND OTHER SENSIBLE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. ALWAYS
      USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AND TAKE APPROPRIATE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WHEN
      COMMUNICATING WITH OR MEETING NEW PEOPLE. COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED
      THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING EMAILS SENT BY CAMPUS FRIENDS, MAY RESULT
      FROM USERS ENGAGING WITH THE SERVICE FOR IMPROPER PURPOSES, INCLUDING
      FRAUD, ABUSE, HARASSMENT, OR OTHER SUCH IMPROPER BEHAVIOR.</p>


    <br><br>
